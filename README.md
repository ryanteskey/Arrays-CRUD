CIS 282
Arrays-CRUD Assignment

To turn in:
	Attach a file crud_lastname.rb as an attachment to the assignment in Blackboard
	Subject line: CIS 282, Name, Arrays - CRUD

To do:

•	Write a menu driven program that will
1.	add, delete, update a person (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2.	view all people
3.	view all people that begin with a user provided letter letter (case-insensitive)
4.	view youngest and oldest person
5.	view all people younger than 21
6.	A person is represented by a name and an age.  You’ll use parallel arrays to manage a list of names and their ages.
7.	For example,
8.	names = [“tom”,”dick”,”harry”]
9.	ages = [35,53,23]
10.	the values at each index are related to each other so if you perform CRUD actions to one you have to do perform it also on the other.
11.	ie. names[0] is related to ages[0].  names[0] 's age is 35.
